# HTML and CSS Module 4

## Task 4

### Brief
In this lesson task we'll be finishing up on the Guitar Kings website by taking a look at how we could have made the products on our website dynamically using JavaScript. We haven't covered JavaScript so far so you don't need to attempt it first to see the answer, the video will just be posted below.

Although it goes beyond the scope of this subject, it might be of interest to you to see how we can dynamically add products to the website instead of hard-coding it.
