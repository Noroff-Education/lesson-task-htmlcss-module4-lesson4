# HTML and CSS Module 4

## Task 4

### Brief
In this lesson task we'll be wrapping up our website by taking a look at how we could have made the products on our website dynamically using JavaScript. We haven't covered JavaScript so far, but it might be of interest to some to see how we can dynamically add products to the website instead of hard-coding it.
